Free (as in freedom) Coca Cola

FreeCola is a brand of free cola that, unlike OpenCola, the term "Free" is used instead of "Open Source", because "free" is weaker than "open-source", according to Richard Stallman. The instructions for making it are freely available and modifiable.

Anybody can make the drink, and anyone can modify and improve on the recipe as long as they,
too, license their recipe under the GNU General Public License. Since recipes are, by themselves, not copyrightable,
the legal basis for this is untested.[1]

Freedom!
